    "# Programming Assignment: Social Network Database Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've reached a practical part of our course, **Generative AI for Software Development - AI-Powered Software and System Design**. This task is all about diving into a database designed for managing a social network. It's a hands-on challenge to test your skills and see how well you can work with AI tools, like a Language Learning Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to fix a database code that's not working right. It's supposed to handle a social network with two main parts: a `Person` table and a `Club` table. There's a mistake in the code, and it's up to you to find and correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fix the Database:** Hunt down the mistake messing up the database and correct it.\n",
    "2. **Write Three Functions:** Use the LLM to help you craft three functions. They should:\n",
    "   - List all members of a specific club.\n",
    "   - List all friends of a specific person.\n",
    "   - List all people who consider a specific person their friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ask the LLM for Help:** Use the LLM to guide you through fixing the database and creating your functions.\n",
    "- **Use Its Advice Wisely:** Remember, the LLM's advice might not always be spot-on. It's up to you to decide what's useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to Submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit this Jupyter notebook containing:\n",
    "- The corrected database code.\n",
    "- The three functions you've written.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How We'll Grade It:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Accuracy:** We'll check if you've successfully identified and fixed the issue in the database.\n",
    "- **Functionality of Your Functions:** We'll see if each of your functions is doing exactly what it's supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be Clear with Your Questions:** The clearer your questions to the LLM, the better help you'll get.\n",
    "- **Test the Advice:** Always test out the LLMâ€™s suggestions to ensure they work as expected.\n",
    "- **Hints**: If you struggle with this assignment, you can check some hints we left to you in the bottom of the assignment!"

Identifying the bugs directly from the code might be challenging for an LLM, **so you might need to implement some of the functions to better understand the issues**. Your analytical skills will be crucial. Note that although you are required to create three functions, your submission will be evaluated on four aspects, one of which is the accuracy of your database. Ensure that you address the issues in the code provided!\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you're tasked with crafting a function called `get_persons_who_consider_them_friend`. This function should take two parameters: the name of an individual and a session. It will return a list of people who count this individual as a friend. It's important to remember that in our database, friendship isn't necessarily mutual. For example, Alice might consider Bob a friend, but Bob might not feel the same way about Alice. **Your function must return a list of Person objects for everyone who considers the input name their friend.** The input to this function should strictly be the **name of the person** you're inquiring about."
