    "In this assignment, you'll start by working with a basic `Graph` class that comes with simple methods. Then, you'll move on to another class named `Graph_Advanced`. Here, you'll be tasked with implementing four methods to tackle four different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the Graph class cannot be modified in any way. However, you're free to add as many methods as you need to the `Graph_Advanced` class to address the challenges you'll encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect you to leverage an LLM (Large Language Model) to aid in developing the algorithms. These algorithms should not only aim for solutions that are close to optimal but also adhere to a specific time execution limit. We provide an LLM with GPT-3.5 for you, the link is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-generative-ai-for-software-development/ungradedLab/Vuqvf/gpt-3-5-environment), but feel free to use the LLM you want!\n",

    "\n",
    "- Begin by clearly defining the problem you are trying to solve or the concept you wish to understand better. Present this to the LLM in a concise manner.\n",
    "- Engage with the LLM as if it were a knowledgeable peer. Ask questions, seek clarifications, and propose hypotheses for the LLM to comment on.\n",
    "- Provide the LLM the Graph class given to you and ask it to explain how it works.\n",
    "- After receiving input from the LLM, critically evaluate the information and decide how best to apply it to your work. Not all suggestions from the LLM may be directly applicable or correct; part of your task is to discern the most valuable advice.\n",

However, passing all the unittests doesn't guarantee success in this assignment, as the autograder will subject your solutions to more extensive testing. To successfully pass this assignment, your solution needs to meet the requirements in more than 85% of the test cases. If your solution fails, you will receive up to three examples highlighting where your algorithm fell short, along with instructions on how to replicate the graphs for debugging purposes."

Share your logic and seek optimization tips to refine your solutions. You can even ask the LLM to build the code for you, with any specification you want.\n",

    "5. **Testing Solutions with LLM**: Use the LLM to strategize and review your testing approach, especially for tests that yield unexpected results. It can offer debugging and optimization advice to improve your solutions.\n",

    "### Exercise 1: The Shortest Path Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop an algorithm to find the quickest route between two points in a sparse graph containing 10,000 nodes, ensuring it executes in less than `0.5` seconds. If you're unsure about your approach or need optimization advice, the LLM is there to provide insights and strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Solving the TSP for Small Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a function that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem for small graphs of about 10 nodes, starting at node 0. The solution must be efficient, completing the task in under `1` second. The LLM can serve as a valuable resource for exploring algorithmic solutions and improving your code's efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Tackling the TSP for Large Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Address the Traveling Salesman Problem for large graphs with 1,000 nodes. The goal isn't to find the perfect solution but to approach it closely within `0.5` seconds. When faced with the complexity of this challenge, the LLM can offer guidance on heuristic approaches and performance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4: The TSP Medium Graphs Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on medium-sized graphs with 300 nodes and develop an algorithm that performs better than your solution for larger graphs, with a completion time of less than `1.3` seconds. The LLM is ready to assist by sharing insights on algorithmic efficiency and helping you surpass your previous solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing functions are provided to validate your algorithms. Run these without modifications after completing each exercise. They offer immediate feedback, including failure reasons and guidance for improving your solutions. You can test solutions individually, ensuring focused and efficient debugging."

If your algorithm fails a test case, you will be given the call to this function with the appropriate arguments needed to replicate the graph that caused your algorithm to fail.
