[26/10/2022, 22:09:05] Mr Tony Ofili IT: ATTENTION: 
I am directed to announce that due to an exigency, the CAPI Training of Trainers (ToT) that was to commence tomorrow (27/10/ 2022) in all the 36 states & FCT, has been rescheduled. A new date will be communicated. We regret any inconveniences caused.
Regards,
DD (Head- Network & Technical Div)

[27/10/2022, 00:37:59] Mr Mike Npc: You can't regret any inconveniences in a training you know nothing about. I am sure this directive is not coming from the Director ICT who is highly respected and knows the implications of this. Someone has been on this CAPI since preparation for census duelly approved by the Chairman of the commission to do this job why the overbearing attitude sir.  You say you are DD Network and technical support how does that relates to CAPI,  I think we should stop putting square pegs in round holes and allow people to do their work in the department,.
[27/10/2022, 18:29:23] Kadejo: Good evening House,
For those of us in the FCT, let's stay safe and try not to keep late nights. The news on insecurity is not a rumour but fact. May we not fall victim of terrorism..Amin

              Finance Manager
[07/04/2023, 12:31:51] Mr Ocupy: Nothing in life is worth fighting for. Your best clothes is someone's rag,your account balance is someone's donation at a function, your girl friend/boy friend or fiance/fiancee' is someone's Ex. Every single prostitute you see in a hotel or on the street at night was at some point in time a virgin. So what is the squabble all about? Life is too small to feel bigger or better than anybody. We're all naked to death says Steve Jobs.  Nothing can save us from it. I hate to see people who Brag about wealth, beauty, intelligence, level of education, fame and material possessions. There's nothing you've achieved in life that no one else has never gotten. There's only one thing that is worth bragging which is "LIVE IN GOD ALMIGHTY". SO BE GOOD TO YOUR FELLOW MAN AND ALWAYS MAKE FRIENDS. Always remember that the people you trampled upon on your way up a ladder will be the same set of people you're likely to pass on your way down, so cause no problem for others because if you do, they'll become your very problem one day. Finally, even banana stems will one day become dried leaves.... Be nice to people as many are passing through a lot ✍️
