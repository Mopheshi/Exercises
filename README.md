## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Linguistics, concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It involves tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, named entity recognition, and more. This repository serves as a hub for NLP enthusiasts to explore, learn, and collaborate on various projects and exercises.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of text data using various techniques such as bag-of-words, word embeddings, and deep learning models.
2. **Text Classification**: Classify text documents into predefined categories or labels using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning architectures.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Build models to identify and classify entities mentioned in unstructured text, such as names of persons, organizations, locations, etc.
4. **Language Translation**: Develop systems for translating text from one language to another using techniques like sequence-to-sequence models, attention mechanisms, and transformers.
5. **Text Generation**: Generate human-like text based on input prompts using techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, or generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Feel free to explore these projects, contribute your own ideas, or suggest improvements!
