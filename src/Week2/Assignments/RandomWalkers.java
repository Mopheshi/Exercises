    /**
     * Write a program RandomWalkers.java that takes two integer command-line arguments r and trials. In each of trials
     * independent experiments, simulate a random walk until the random walker is at Manhattan distance r from the
     * starting point. Print the average number of steps.
     * <p>
     * As r increases, we expect the random walker to take more and more steps. But how many more steps? Use
     * RandomWalkers.java to formulate a hypothesis as to how the average number of steps grows as a function of r.
     * <p>
     * Estimating an unknown quantity by generating random samples and aggregating the results is an example of Monte
     * Carlo simulationâ€”a powerful computational technique that is used widely in statistical physics, computational
     * finance, and computer graphics.
