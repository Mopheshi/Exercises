public class Minesweeper {
    // Minesweeper is a 1960s era video game played on an m-by-n grid of cells. The goal is to deduce which cells contain hidden mines using clues about the number of mines in neighboring cells. Write a program Minesweeper.java that takes three integer command-line arguments m, n, and k and prints an m-by-n grid of cells with k mines, using asterisks for mines and integers for the neighboring mine counts (with two space characters between each cell). To do so,
    //Generate an m-by-n grid of cells, with exactly k of the mn cells containing mines, uniformly at random.
    //For each cell not containing a mine, count the number of neighboring mines (above, below, left, right, or diagonal).

    //Submission. Submit a .zip file containing DiscreteDistribution.java, ThueMorse.java, Birthday.java, and Minesweeper.java. You may not call library functions except those in the java.lang (such as Integer.parseInt() and Math.sqrt()). Use only Java features that have already been introduced in the course (e.g., loops and arrays, but not functions).
