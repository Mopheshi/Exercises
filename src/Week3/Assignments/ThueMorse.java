    //The Thue–Morse sequence is an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s that is constructed by starting with 0 and successively appending the bitwise negation (interchange 0s and 1s) of the existing sequence. Here are the first few steps of this construction:
    //0010110011010010110100110010110
    //To visualize the Thue–Morse sequence, create an n-by-n pattern by printing a + (plus sign) in row i
    // and column j
    // if bits i
    // and j
    // in the sequence are equal, and a - (minus sign) if they are different.
    //Thue–Morse weave
    //Note: you may assume that n is a positive integer (but it need not be a power of 2).
    //
    //The Thue–Morse sequence has many fascinating properties and arises in graphic design and in music composition.
    // It is named after Axel Thue and Marston Morse.
