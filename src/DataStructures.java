public class DataStructures {
//Linked List:
//a. Implement a singly linked list in Java with methods to:
//Insert a node at the beginning/end of the list.
//Delete a node with a given value.
//Search for a node with a given value.
//Traverse the list and print its elements.
//b. Implement a doubly linked list in Java with similar functionalities.
//c. Provide the time complexity analysis for each operation in both singly and doubly linked lists.

//Stack:
//a. Implement a stack data structure in Java using an array.
//b. Implement push and pop operations for the stack.
//c. Write a method to check if a given string containing parentheses (, ), {, }, [, or ] is balanced using a stack.
//d. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using arrays vs. linked lists to implement a stack.

//Queue:
//a. Implement a queue data structure in Java using an array.
//b. Implement enqueue and dequeue operations for the queue.
//c. Implement a circular queue to efficiently use the underlying array space.
//d. Discuss the trade-offs between array-based and linked list-based implementations of queues.


//Binary Search Tree (BST):
//a. Implement a binary search tree in Java with methods to:
//Insert a node.
//Delete a node with a given value.
//Search for a node with a given value.
//Traverse the tree in-order, pre-order, and post-order.
//b. Write a method to find the minimum and maximum values in a BST.
//c. Discuss the time complexity of each operation in a BST and the conditions under which the tree degenerates into a linked list.

    //Hash Table:
//a. Implement a hash table data structure in Java with methods to:
//Insert a key-value pair.
//Retrieve the value associated with a given key.
//Remove a key-value pair.
//b. Implement collision resolution techniques such as chaining or open addressing.
//c. Discuss the factors affecting the choice of hash function and the collision resolution strategy.
