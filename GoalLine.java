/*
    In this implementation, the ball's position is updated based on its velocity and the elapsed time (time step) in each
    iteration. The ball's velocity ('vx', 'vy', and 'vz') determines the rate at which the ball moves in each direction.

    We can as well ask the user to input the value of the ball's velocity (shooting power) and ball's coordinates
    (initial position).

    The time step ('dt') represents the duration between each iteration, allowing us to simulate the ball's movement
    over time. By multiplying the velocity components by the time step, we can determine the displacement of the ball in
    each iteration.

    The rest of the code checks if the ball has crossed the goal line by comparing its coordinates with the goal line's
    coordinates.
